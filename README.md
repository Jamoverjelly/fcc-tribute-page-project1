# fcc-tribute-page-project1
First project in the Free Code Camp front-end certificate series - developing your own tribute page.  My tribute page is dedicated to a good night's sleep and Matthew Walker's new book - *Why We Sleep*

The Tribute Page project will be completed following the guidelines proposed in P1xt's Chingu FCC Speedrun.  Following in their footsteps as I learn to set up some successful GitHub project routines of my own.

## Objective

Develop a Web page that is functionally similar to the FCC example reference page: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can view a tribute page with image and text content about Matthew Walker's book *Why We Sleep*

* User Story: I can click on a link which will take me to another website with more information about this book and author.

## Notes

First steps:

* Created a project sprint charter within GitHub to track task completion and entered all potential major milestones for completing the Tribute page project as a single sprint
* Selected a topic: [Why We Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep:_The_New_Science_of_Sleep_and_Dreams)
* Created a mockup for the tribute page in [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/)

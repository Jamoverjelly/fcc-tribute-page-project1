        <div class="description">
          <p>In <em>Why We Sleep</em> we learn of the massive sleep problem plauging the developed world.  From our work and school schedules that curtail our sleeping through the early hours of the morning (before 6 or 7 AM), to the technologies that keep us ever-connected and maximally engaged with information that seem to always be keeping us awake (sometimes long after 10 PM); Matthew Walker seamlessly threads together the most significant ideas to come out of the past two decades of sleep science.  His book illustrates, in grave detail, the numerous health risks resulting from this onslaught on the precious hours nature has reserved for our nightly rest.   The book is as much an important warning to all humanity as it is an affirmation that good things come to those who sleep.</p>
